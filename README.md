# ðŸ§  C Learning Roadmap

This repository documents my personal journey in learning the C from scratch.

## ðŸ“š Step 1: Foundation with CS50

**Link:** [CS50x 2025 â€“ Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/weeks/0/)

If you havenâ€™t had any formal computer science education, I highly recommend starting here.  
Begin from **Week 0** and continue through **Week 6**. For each week:

- âœ… Watch the lecture
- âœ… Watch the shorts
- âœ… Attend section (if applicable)
- âœ… Complete the problem sets

This course gives a solid base in C and computer science fundamentals.

## ðŸ’» Step 2: Practice with Learning-C Repo

**Link:** [h0mbre/Learning-C GitHub Repository](https://github.com/h0mbre/Learning-C)

After finishing CS50 through Week 6, I moved on to practical exercises using this excellent C practice repo.  
Highly recommend working through this for reinforcing the basics.

## ðŸ§  Step 3: Practice on LeetCode

To strengthen my problem-solving skills, I transitioned to solving C problems on **LeetCode**.
